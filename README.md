# UFOs

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to provide data of different UFO sightings in a HTML format, allowing interested parties the ability to filter for city, dates, countries, and other criteria. 

## Results

Users can filter the website by one or multiple criteria to find specific data on UFO sightings. For example, if someone wanted to find all UFO sightings in St. Louis, MO, they could filter State and City to those inputs, respectively, to get a list of all recorded sightings for that location.

## Summary

While there is a comprehensive list of filter to choose from, there are some drawbacks. For example, only specific MM/DD/YYYY date format can be used. If someone wanted to look up all UFO sighting in a year period, that is not possible in the current design. I recommend adding a year filter as opposed to a date specific filter. Shape is also subjective. I would recommend removing that filter altogether.
